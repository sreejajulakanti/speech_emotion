# Speech Emotion

SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION is a Deep Learning project.

OBJECTIVE: To build a model that recognize emotion from speech.

MLP classifier gives best accuracy , so streamlit part is build with MLP model.

Likewise any other suitable model is constructed and compare their accuracies and select the best model from them.Train the model and get accuarcy
